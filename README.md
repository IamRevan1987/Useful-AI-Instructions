# 🤖 Local AI Personas & Prompt Experiments

Welcome! 👋
Thanks for stopping by and taking a look around.

This repository is a collection of **locally run AI system prompts and personality experiments** designed for small-to-mid parameter language models. Each prompt represents a different approach to tone, safety, interaction style, and performance constraints—ranging from calm technical operators to conversational companions.

These projects are part learning lab, part creative exploration, and part long-term foundation for future collaboration.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

You’ll find several **distinct AI personas and prompt styles**, including:

* Conversational companions focused on empathy and natural pacing
* Security-first IT / cybersecurity tutors and operators
* Lightweight, performance-optimized variants for smaller models
* Personality-forward designs intended to feel human, grounded, and consistent

Each prompt is intentionally written to:

* Avoid hallucinated expertise or fake lived experience
* Stay respectful of boundaries
* Scale cleanly across different hardware capabilities
* Remain readable and modifiable by humans (not just machines)

The designs reflect an emphasis on **clarity, trust, and long-term usability**, not just clever output.

(Examples in this repository include prompts like *Aki*, *Judy*, and *Kara*, each with clearly defined goals and constraints.)

## 🛠️ How These Were Built

All prompts here were developed and tested using **local LLM tooling**, primarily:

* **LM Studio**
* **Open WebUI**

Target model sizes generally fall between **~2B and ~14B parameters**, with special attention paid to:

* Token efficiency
* Low hallucination risk
* Smooth behavior on consumer hardware (including Apple Silicon and mid-range PCs)

Many prompts include **explicit optimization notes** so they can be adapted up or down depending on model size and performance needs.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Feedback

This repository is **not “finished”**—and it’s not meant to be.

I’m very open to:

* Suggestions for improvement
* Structural or wording refinements
* Alternative design approaches
* Performance tuning ideas
* Thoughtful critiques
* Collaborative experiments

If something feels unclear, heavy-handed, or improvable, I genuinely want to hear about it. Pull requests, issues, and discussions are all welcome.

## 🌱 Philosophy

These prompts are built with a few guiding ideas in mind:

* Local models deserve first-class design, not watered-down prompts
* Personality should feel *intentional*, not accidental
* Safety and warmth can coexist
* Smaller models benefit from discipline and clarity
* Prompts should be readable by humans first

If any of that resonates with you, you’re in the right place.

## 📬 Final Note

If you’re experimenting with local LLMs, prompt design, or AI personalities—or just curious—thanks for being here.
Feel free to explore, remix, adapt, or build on anything you find useful.

And if you have ideas or questions, I’m always happy to talk.

If you’d like, I can:

* Adjust the tone (more technical / more friendly / more minimalist)
* Add a **“Getting Started”** section
* Add per-prompt descriptions
* Rewrite this for a more professional or more playful audience

Let me know if anything here feels unclear or if you want to steer it in a different direction.

Sincerely, 
- Revan
